1.) I learned what a Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) is.  It used to be the dominant type of display which is still used in the movie industry.  What happens is; when electrons strike the phosphor coating on the tube, light is then emmited.  Deflection plates change the direction of the beam, while the output o fthe computer is coverted to voltages across the x and y deflection plates. Light then appears on the surface of the CRT when there is sufficent electrions directed towards the phosphor.

2.) I then learned about what came after the CRT such as display processors, pipeline architectures, graphics pipeline, vertex processing, clipping and primitive assembly, rasterization, and finally fragment processing.
